# HeavyweightGreats
Final project for DigitalCrafts 2018 cohort in Houston. The overall idea for the project was to create a repeatable way outside of Wordpress to rank fighters by weight class. This initial cms will be rolled out to other weight classes as it progresses and possibly be used for current rankings and pound-for-pounds lists. 

### Prerequisites

This is a NodeJS project that connects to a postgreSQL database and a JSON file. 

Here are the dependencies: 
    "bluebird": "^3.5.1",
    "body-parser": "^1.18.3",
    "ejs": "^2.5.8",
    "express": "^4.16.3",
    "i": "^0.3.6",
    "pg-promise": "^8.4.4"

The database is postgreSQL 10. I also used Postico to manage my tables and data.
